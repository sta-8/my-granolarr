# Pipe example

This is my first [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tinytex)
```
The code uses the pipe operator:

- takes 2 as input
- calculates the square root
- rounds the value
    - keeping only two digits

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2 %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  round(digits = 2)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
